# Effects on traits and trait-trait correlation

These are the traits to be used for measuring effect of treatments and correlations among traits. Not all the data from the experiments is included as more dynamic analysis is performed in the modelling papers.

## Growth and performance

DW = Aboveground dry weight (mg)
Yield = Seed production (mg)

## Development
Phyllochron = Average number of days to produce a new leaf (d) calculated from FT and total number of leaves produced
FT = Days to first flower (d)

## Physiology (older plants)
N = Average leaf nitrogen:carbon ratio of the plant
Nmol = Average leaf nitrogen content per unit of leaf area
RWC = Relative leaf water content of leaves
Chl = Chlorophyll content pero unit of leaf area
A = Net CO2 assimilation  under growth ligh and temperature
gsw = Stomatal conductance  under growth ligh and temperature
Rd = Leaf respiration in the light under growth light and temperature
LUE = Low light light use efficiency of A

## Rosette morphology (young plants)

RootLength = Maximum depth of the root system (cm)
Angle = Angle of petiole insertion with respect to horizontal plane (°)
PetioleRatio = Ratio between petiole length and total leaf (petiole + blade) length
ShapeBlade = Ratio between blade width and length
LeafSize = Average leaf area
SLA = Specific leaf area

## Seed morphology
SW = Average seed weight (mg)
SL = Median seed size (um)
σSL = Mean absolute deviation in seed size within a plant (um)
